## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Oziel

I'm a Software Engineer based in Monterrey, Mexico.

I consider myself a code artisan â€” I believe software is a mix of engineering and art and should be crafted with care, passion, and purpose in mind.

I build and lead the development of robust web applications using Ruby on Rails and Laravel but Iâ€™m always curious and open to trying new tools.
